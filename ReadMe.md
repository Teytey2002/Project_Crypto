# Symmetric cryptography and hashing

> [!NOTE]
> This is an academic project. The instructions for this project can be found [here](./doc/INFO-F-405-Project-symmetric.pdf)

This project is a simple implementation of the ABCD permutation. It then builds on it by implementing
- A sponge construction on top of ABCD permutation
- An authentication (MAC) scheme using the ABCD sponge
- An encryption scheme using the ABCD sponge
- A hash function
